This directory contains various output images of CloudSat orbit(s) and photos about how CloudSat scans the Earth's atmosphere. This is the first step of my work related to CloudSat, which includes plotting groundtracks along with proper time stamps, color coding as per different parameters. 

Let's say we want to see the cloud top height as measured by CloudSat during one orbit. We can easily plot it by making the color of the groundtrack, a function of the parameter (here, cloud top height).

- Groundtrack is the path traced on Earth, by a satellite, as it moves along its orbit.

- The instantaneous scanning area of CloudSat is 1.3 km Ã— 1.7 km. A smaller instantaneous scanning area (or pixel size) it makes our task a lot simpler, as compared to satellites who do sideways scan. 

- CloudSat completes 14-15 orbits per day. It traces the exact same groundtrack after an interval of 16 days.
