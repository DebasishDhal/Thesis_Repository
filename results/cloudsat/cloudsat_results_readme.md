# Cloudsat only results
This folder consists of analysis based on data from CloudSat satellite alone. It's divided into 3 sections.

## Cloud height distribution
- Please check the photos done of the cloud mean top-height, mean base-height and mean thickness in the folder above.
- The analysis has been done on different cloud types separetly. We're considering 8 distinct cloud types here.


Below are some of the findings of the analysis.

- Cirrus is the only type of cloud with a high base and high top height. As a result, it has a low thickness.
- Nimbostratus and deep convective clouds have their base at low heights but top at very high altitudes. Hence, they have a large thickness
-  Stratus, stratocumulus, and cumulus clouds have low base and top heights. Their thickness is comparable to that of cirrus clouds as a result.
