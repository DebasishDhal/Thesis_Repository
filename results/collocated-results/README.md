In this folder, you can find the maps generated by us, using the models which were developed by training on the collocated dataset. 

The maps show three predicted parameters in total : - Cloudy/Clear classification, Cloud top height and Cloud total thickness

The codes required to generate the maps can be found in the codes sub-folder of each of the three folders.
