Here is a simple analysis of how the solar elevation angle changes with the seasons. The two pictures are taken at an interval of exactly six months, at the same GMT. 
It can be observed that the solar elevation angles in the two images are complementary to each other. In the summer solstice period, the sun is centered over the northern hemisphere
while in the winter solstice, it is centered over the southern hemisphere.
